
# To-Do

  

- Integrate Monte Carlo Sims with CVaR Optimization

- Make everything robust

- Migrate the good stuff from Project 1

  

# When Running the Code

  

- The `config.json` file contains most of the configurable parameters and optimization/factor techniques. This is to make sure we don't run in to errors with compatibility between our computers. When you are creating a new algorithm, please put all parameters in that file and read it like I have in `Project2_Function.m`
- You may get errors when you run this, because I put files in folders. Run these lines before compiling:
	- `addpath('MonteCarlo')`
	- `addpath('OptimizationTechniques')`
	- `addpath('Data')`
	- `addpath('Util')`
    - `addpath('FactorModels')`
